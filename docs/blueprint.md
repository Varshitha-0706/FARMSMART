# **App Name**: Krishi Sahayak

## Core Features:

- Farmer Registration: Allow farmers to register with their name, phone number, location (state, district, village), and crop types via a web interface.
- AI Crop Monitoring: Allow farmers to upload or take a picture of a crop leaf to receive AI-powered analysis for disease and pest detection. The system should leverage a pre-trained AI model to identify if the crop is healthy or affected by pests, disease, or stress. Output should include the problem identified, a confidence percentage, and a suggested action. Use of a tool will enable LLM reasoning about confidence.
- Interactive Dashboard: Present uploaded images and AI analysis results through an interactive dashboard. The dashboard should include a map/field layout highlighting problem areas and a crop health summary. Design this as a SPA.
- Market Intelligence System: Display current market prices for the farmer's selected crops across nearby markets. Show trending crops in demand and a forecast to suggest the best time to sell for maximum profit.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A deep, earthy green (#347C09) evokes nature and growth, aligning with agriculture.
- Background color: A very light, desaturated beige (#F5F5DC) to create a clean, neutral backdrop that does not distract from the content.
- Accent color: A warm, muted yellow (#D4A22D) adds a touch of vibrancy and draws attention to important elements such as call-to-action buttons and key information.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif which combines a modern look and a little warmth or personality, will be suitable for both headlines and body text
- Employ simple, intuitive icons to represent crop types, diseases, and market trends. Icons should be easily recognizable and complement the overall clean aesthetic.
- Maintain a clean and intuitive layout, ensuring easy navigation. Prioritize a mobile-first design approach, optimizing the experience for farmers accessing the platform on their phones. Content should be well-organized, with clear visual hierarchy.
- Subtle transitions and animations, such as loading indicators or expanding sections, enhance user engagement. Ensure animations are smooth and non-intrusive.
