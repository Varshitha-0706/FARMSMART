# **App Name**: Krishi Sahayak

## Core Features:

- Farmer Registration: Allow farmers to register with their name, phone number, location (state, district, village), and crop types via a web interface.
- AI Crop Monitoring: Allow farmers to upload or take a picture of a crop leaf to receive AI-powered analysis for disease and pest detection. The system should leverage a pre-trained AI model to identify if the crop is healthy or affected by pests, disease, or stress. Output should include the problem identified, a confidence percentage, and a suggested action. Use of a tool will enable LLM reasoning about confidence.
- Interactive Dashboard: Present uploaded images and AI analysis results through an interactive dashboard. The dashboard should include a map/field layout highlighting problem areas and a crop health summary. Design this as a SPA.
- Market Intelligence System: Display current market prices for the farmer's selected crops across nearby markets. Show trending crops in demand and a forecast to suggest the best time to sell for maximum profit.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A deep, earthy green (#347C09) evokes nature and growth, aligning with agriculture.
- Background color: A very light, desaturated beige (#F5F5DC) to create a clean, neutral backdrop that does not distract from the content.
- Accent color: A warm, muted yellow (#D4A22D) adds a touch of vibrancy and draws attention to important elements such as call-to-action buttons and key information.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif which combines a modern look and a little warmth or personality, will be suitable for both headlines and body text
- Employ simple, intuitive icons to represent crop types, diseases, and market trends. Icons should be easily recognizable and complement the overall clean aesthetic.
- Maintain a clean and intuitive layout, ensuring easy navigation. Prioritize a mobile-first design approach, optimizing the experience for farmers accessing the platform on their phones. Content should be well-organized, with clear visual hierarchy.
- Subtle transitions and animations, such as loading indicators or expanding sections, enhance user engagement. Ensure animations are smooth and non-intrusive.

# **App Name**: FARMSMART

## Core Features:

- Pest Attack Prediction: Predict pest attacks using machine learning models based on weather data, historical pest outbreaks, and crop type. The predictions can tool consider regional data to tailor the output to specific geographic factors.
- Crop Yield Forecasting: Forecast crop yield using machine learning algorithms that analyze weather patterns, soil data, and historical yield data. The models tool can make predictions on optimal fertilizer use based on similar reasoning.
- Voice Assistant: Enable farmers to ask questions in their local language via voice and receive spoken responses. The app translates the spoken prompts into text, generates AI output, then the application converts the textual response into spoken audio using a text-to-speech service.
- Geo-Based Advisory: Provide personalized recommendations based on the farmer's specific farm location, crop type, and soil conditions, leveraging geolocation and satellite data. Dynamically filter and present only highly relevant information and advisory.
- Image Recognition: Allow farmers to upload photos of their plants to detect pests or diseases using image recognition AI.
- Market Trend Forecasting: Suggest the best time to sell crops by forecasting market trends using historical price data and other relevant economic indicators.
- Data Integration: Integrate data from various sources, including weather APIs (IMD, OpenWeatherMap), market price portals (Agmarknet), pest data (ICAR/FAO), and satellite data (ISRO Bhuvan).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Earthy Green (#6B8E23) to symbolize growth, nature, and agriculture.
- Background color: Very light, desaturated Green (#F5F5DC), providing a neutral, soothing backdrop.
- Accent color: Warm Yellow-Gold (#FFD700) for important alerts, calls to action, and highlights to evoke feelings of prosperity and harvest.
- Font pairing: 'Alegreya', a serif font, for headlines to provide an elegant, intellectual feel; 'PT Sans', a sans-serif font, for body text to ensure readability and a modern touch.
- Use clear, simple icons representing weather conditions, crop types, pests, and market data to aid quick recognition and comprehension.
- Implement a card-based layout for information modules, offering a clean, organized display that adapts to different screen sizes.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations for loading data and updating information, providing a smooth and engaging user experience.
